# Target---Monitor
No longer functional Target monitor with discord webhook support.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, high-demand items were constantly out of stock on Target.com. This script was designed to monitor specific products on Target's website and notify users via Discord when an item comes back in stock. It helps shoppers get the products they need by providing real-time updates.
